    "#Viewing Your [RunKeeper](https://runkeeper.com/) Data in [CartoDB](https://cartodb.com/)\n",
    "[RunKeeper](https://runkeeper.com/) is a great app for recording runs and other workout adventures. While its fun to see your workout on the app, it can also be exported and viewed and analyzed. [CartoDB](https://cartodb.com/) is a great mapping platform for visualizing your data. In this exercise, I'll show the following steps:\n",

    "1. Export your RunKeeper data GPX files. \n",
    "2. Merge all RunKeeper GPX files to a single Shapefile using [GDAL/OGR](http://www.gdal.org/index.html) with [OSGEO4W](http://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/). \n",
    "3. Zip shapefile and upload to CartoDB. \n",
